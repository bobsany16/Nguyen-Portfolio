# Nguyen-Portfolio
This is how I used Bootstrap theme to create my portfolio website. Heavily fixed and restyled CSS. Deployed on AWS Lambda. As a perfectionist, colors and how they blend together is a must. Everything must be fabulous and immaculate. 

# Looking ahead
Although this is a Starter Bootstrap, this will pave the way for me develop far more sophisticated websites. My goasl are to try Gatsby.JS 

# At last, enjoy :)
